# Enhanced User Interface: Improve the overall look and feel of the application 
# by refining the user interface, applying attractive styles, and ensuring a responsive 
# design that works well on different devices and screen sizes.

# Authentication and User Management: Implement user authentication and user 
# management features to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profile data. 
# This could include features like password reset, email verification, and user roles/permissions.

# Database Integration: Integrate a database backend (such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase) 
# to store and manage application data. This would enable more robust data persistence and allow 
# for advanced data querying and manipulation.
